# COE891
Lab work and final project for COE 891 (Software Testing and Quality Assurance) Feel free to reference, but avoid copying.

Exploreing a diverse range of methodologies for verifying and validating software as well as software-hardware co-design systems, placing a special focus on the intricacies of designing and implementing system-level software. This encompasses System-On-Chip systems, Electronic-Design-Automation tool flows, and embedded systems.

Key Objectives:
1. Developing a deep understanding of systematic methods to debug complex object oriented
   programs.
2. Be able to develop, maintain, document and execute test cases.
3. Understand and implement at different testing levels including unit, integration, system and
   operational acceptance levels.
4. Be able to develop documentation for testing exercises and communicate findings with
   developers.
5. Consider environmental implications of software programs when testing for operational
   acceptance.
6. Plan for software testing projects with continuous integration and test-driven development.
